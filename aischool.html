        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. These machines are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.</p>
        <p>AI technologies can be categorized into three main types: Narrow AI, General AI, and Superintelligent AI. Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed and trained for a specific task, while General AI would have the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can do. Superintelligent AI would surpass human intelligence and capabilities.</p>

        <h2>Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

        <h3>1. Reactive Machines</h3>
        <p>Reactive machines are AI systems that have no memory and are task-specific, meaning that an input always delivers the same output. Machine learning models tend to be reactive machines because they take customer data, such as purchase or search history, and use it to deliver recommendations to the same customers.</p>
        <p>Reactive AI, for the most part, is reliable and works well in inventions like self-driving cars. It doesn’t have the ability to predict future outcomes unless it has been fed the appropriate information.</p>
        <h4>Examples of reactive machines:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Beat at chess by IBM’s supercomputer: Deep Blue</li>
            <li>Netflix recommendations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Limited Memory Machines</h3>
        <p>Limited memory AI imitates the way our brains’ neurons work together, meaning that it gets smarter as it receives more data to train on. Unlike reactive machines, limited memory AI can look into the past and monitor specific objects or situations over time.</p>
        <h4>Example of limited memory AI:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-driving cars</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Theory of Mind</h3>
        <p>Theory of mind AI could potentially understand the world and how other entities have thoughts and emotions. This affects how they behave in relation to those around them. This type of AI is theoretical and not yet realized.</p>

        <h3>4. Self-awareness</h3>
        <p>Self-awareness in AI would mean systems that have a sense of self, a conscious understanding of their existence. This type of AI does not exist yet but represents the ultimate goal in AI development.</p>
